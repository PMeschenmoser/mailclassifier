ABCNews Lifestyle: Safe, Painless Alternative to Surgically Removing Embarrassing Moles, Only Here-- http://findithere.jbleave.us/r/6357167  


One of my favorite places to eat anywhere! Amazing gyros! Seriously the nicest owner ever. If you like good Greek food, he knows how to do it. Great little place.  Meal started with crostini,  then excellent lentil soup,  next a delicious tossed salad with mixed greens followed by our entrees.... Best Mexican in both Montgomery and Tippecanoe counties (Lindo Mexico)...Great food ..Great people ..Great service ..Great atmosphere. I made the waiter nervous, but he survived.  The chicken chili soup is delicious and they cooked my steak perfectly.  The baked potato was perfection AFTER... Food was great.  Apparently the fries are endless as the waitress asked if we wanted more.  My wife got a gluten-free bun.  Nice to have that as well.... Discovered this place on our way home from Shades State Park. Best authentic tacos I've had since moving from California. Perfectly seasoned carne asada \u0026... Wow,  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
