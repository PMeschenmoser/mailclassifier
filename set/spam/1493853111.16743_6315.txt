My name is Mrs Aziza H Mohammed, i am from Libya and my husband is one of the late Gaddafi Army. It was my husband who took Gaddafi family to Niger and Algeria when they ran from Libya. But my husband died when he returned to Libya, their army convoy was hit by NATO bomb. But he told me something very important when he was alive. He deposited some money in a security company as a family inheritance in case anything should happen to Him. And he gave me the documents to save them for security reason, He said the money is Eight Million six hundred Thousand, and 67 kilos of gold.

I have wished to confide this to a trustworthy person but i am afraid to encounter betrayal. I am presently out of Libya because we ran out during the war. why I write you is because I need someone who can stand on my behalf to claim ownership of the fund and the Gold. I have a certificate of deposit covering the deposited items. contact me to privately on my email (muhhaziaz@gmail.com)

Regard,

Madam Aziza H Mohammed
