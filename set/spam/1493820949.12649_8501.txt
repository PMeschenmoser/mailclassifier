TESTIMONIALS: Haven't been woken up once with my legs on fire - "I tried your Nerve Renew and haven't been woken up once with my legs on fire since. Doctors gave me nothing that helped. Only pain meds or sleep meds. The tingling in my legs and feet is mostly gone now. I only have occasional stabbing pains. Thank you so much for your wonderful product." ~ Marilyn Bell - Las Vegas, NV
