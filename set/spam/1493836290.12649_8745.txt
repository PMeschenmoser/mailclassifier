<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Mother's Day is May 14</p>

<!-- Paragraph 1 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">You want to find something she'll use all the time, but it can't be strictly utilitarian???you want to find something with a sentimental spin, too. But overthinking it is only going to make the whole process harder??? and before you know it, it'll be the day before Mother's Day and you'll still be empty-handed (now that's stressful!). Instead, think about what makes your mom happy (besides you, of course!). Does she like to garden? Or maybe she'd rather spend her afternoon reading in a cozy nook? Anything that brings her a bit of inner peace in an always-on world is likely to win her over. And lucky for you, our editors have cherry-picked more than 50 unique items that fall into a wide variety of interests. Some are just right for gardeners or readers, others are just right for those techies out there, and even more are simply sweet and could suit just about anyone. Our recommendation? Check this list twice, put your favorites in your shopping cart, wait for the gifts to show up on your doorstep, wrap them in a pretty bow, and watch as mom opens with awe. Consider this to be the easiest and most successful Mother's Day yet.
