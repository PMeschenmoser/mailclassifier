  <p style=3D"font-size: 7.8px">Stars do it. Sports do it. Judges in the hi=
ghest courts do it. Let's do it: that yoga thing. A path to enlightenment t=
hat winds back 5,000 years in its native India, yoga has suddenly become so=
 hot, so cool, so very this minute. It's the exercise cum meditation for th=
e new millennium, one that doesn't so much pump you up as bliss you out. Yo=
ga now straddles the continent &acirc;?? from Hollywood, where $20 million-=
a-picture actors queue for a session with their guru du jour, to Washington=
, where, in the gym of the Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and 1=
5 others faithfully take their class each Tuesday morning. Everywhere else,=
 Americans rush from their high-pressure jobs and tune in to the authoritat=
ively mellow voice of an instructor, gently urging them to solder a union (=
the literal translation of the Sanskrit word yoga) between mind and body. T=
hese Type A strivers want to become Type B seekers, to lose their blues in =
an asana (pose), to graduate from distress to de-stress. Fifteen million Am=
ericans include some form of yoga in their fitness regimen &acirc;?? twice =
as many as did five years ago; 75% of all U.S. health clubs offer yoga clas=
ses. Many in those classes are looking not inward but behind. As supermodel=
 Christy Turlington, a serious practitioner, says, &quot;Some of my friends=
 simply want to have a yoga butt.&quot; But others come to the discipline i=
n hopes of restoring their troubled bodies. Yoga makes me feel better, they=
 say. Maybe it can cure what ails me. Oprah Winfrey, arbiter of moral and l=
iterary betterment for millions of American women, devoted a whole show to =
the benefits of yoga earlier this month, with guest appearances by Turlingt=
on and stud-muffin guru Rodney Yee. Testimonials from everyday yogis and yo=
ginis clogged the hour: I lost weight; I quit smoking; I conquered my fear =
of flying; I can sleep again; it saved my marriage; it improved my daughter=
's grades and attitude. &quot;We are more centered as a team,&quot; declare=
d the El Monte Firefighters of Los Altos Hills, Calif.</p>=20
  <p style=3D"font-size: 7.8px">Sounds great. Namaste, as your instructor s=
ays at the end of a session: the divine in me bows to the divine in you. Bu=
t let's up the ante a bit. Is yoga more than the power of positive breathin=
g? Can it, say, cure cancer? Fend off heart attacks? Rejuvenate post-menopa=
usal women? Just as important for yoga's application by mainstream doctors,=
 can its presumed benefits be measured by conventional medical standards? I=
s yoga, in other words, a science? By even asking the question, we provoke =
a clash of two powerful cultures, two very different ways of looking at the=
 world. The Indian tradition develops metaphors and ways of describing the =
body (life forces, energy centers) as it is experienced, from the inside ou=
t. The Western tradition looks at the body from the outside in, peeling it =
back one layer at a time, believing only what it can see, measure and prove=
 in randomized, double-blind tests. The East treats the person; the West tr=
eats the disease. &quot;Our system of medicine is very fragmented,&quot; sa=
ys Dr. Carrie Demers, who runs the Center for Health and Healing at the Him=
alayan International Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy of the USA in=
 Honesdale, Pa. &quot;We send you to different specialists to look at diffe=
rent parts of you. Yoga is more holistic; it's interested in the integratio=
n of body, breath and mind.&quot;</p>=20
  <p style=3D"font-size: 7.8px">The few controlled studies that have been d=
one offer cause for hope. A 1990 study of patients who had coronary heart d=
isease indicated that a regimen of aerobic exercise and stress reduction, i=
ncluding yoga, combined with a low-fat vegetarian diet, stabilized and in s=
ome cases reversed arterial blockage. The author Dr. Dean Ornish is in the =
midst of a study involving men with prostate cancer. Can diet, yoga and med=
itation affect the progress of this disease? So far, Ornish will say only t=
hat the data are encouraging. To the skeptic, all evidence is anecdotal. Bu=
t some anecdotes are more than encouraging; they are inspiring. Consider Su=
e Cohen, 54, an accountant, breast-cancer survivor and five-year yoga stude=
nt at the Unity Woods studio in Bethesda, Md. &quot;After my cancer surgery=
,&quot; Cohen says, &quot;I thought I might never lift my arm again. Then h=
ere I am one day, standing on my head, leaning most of my 125-lb. body weig=
ht on that arm I thought I'd never be able to use again. Chemotherapy, surg=
ery and some medications can rob you of mental acuity, but yoga helps compe=
nsate for the loss. It impels you to do things you never thought you were c=
apable of doing.&quot;</p>=20
  <p style=3D"font-size: 7.8px">A series of exercises as old as the Sphinx =
could prove to be the medical miracle of tomorrow &acirc;?? or just wishful=
 thinking from the millions who have embraced yoga in a bit more than a gen=
eration. Yoga was little known in the U.S. &acirc;?? perhaps only as an ent=
husiasm of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and other icons of the Beat Generat=
ion &acirc;?? when the Beatles and Mia Farrow journeyed to India to sit at =
the feet of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1968. Since then, yoga has endured=
 more evolutions of popular consciousness than a morphing movie monster. Fi=
rst it signaled spiritual cleansing and rebirth, a nontoxic way to get high=
 Then it was seen as a kind of preventive medicine that helped manage and =
reduce stress. &quot;The third wave was the fitness wave,&quot; says Richar=
d Faulds, president of the Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health in Lenox, Mas=
s. &quot;And that's about strength and flexibility and endurance.&quot;</p>=
