If you suspect you have a mold problem, it isn't wise to try to assess it yourself. Even if the problem is small and you think you can take care of it yourself, you will never know unless you call for a professional mold test. Some basic guidelines to follow: it's a good idea to call a professional if the mold covers a 3x3 foot area or larger, if the mold is growing on wood or drywall, if the mold appears to be black mold, if you have a medical condition that may be exacerbated by exposure to mold, if you or other property occupants have been having symptoms of mold exposure, if you suspect mold inside your walls or mold inside your subfloor, or if your property has a distinct moldy smell.

<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Mold FAQs</p>

<!-- Paragraph 1 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">How do I know if I have a mold problem in my home or business?
Signs that you may have mold include: a pungent smell, visual indications, a water leak, or symptoms of mold exposure. When it is confined to one area of your home, you may notice an unpleasant odor when you are in that area. Mold can sometimes live within the walls or behind wallpaper, and so you might not immediately associate the smell with mold. One very important step in properly diagnosing a potential mold or indoor air quality problem is always to inquire by phone and report any current or past problem conditions, such as but not limited to the following: humidity or condensation problems, moldy odors, past or present roof leaks, plumbing leaks, or any visible mold observed.
</p>

<!-- Paragraph 2 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">What is the process for mold testing?
The process for testing for mold in your home or business will include a visit out to your property, and some or all of the following: a visual mold assessment, an indoor air quality sample (to see if there is mold in the air), a visual assessment, and sampling of the area where mold is suspected, and visual and written documentation of the area. 
</p>

<!-- Paragraph 3 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">What is the cost for mold removal?
Mold removal cost depends on the size and type of area that is mold-infested, the type of mold that must be handled, and the amount of repair work that must be done after the mold is remediated. When you are considering homeowners insurance, be sure to get something that will cover at least part of the remediation cost if you live in a flood zone or near another water source that may cause a mold problem. 
</p>

<!-- Paragraph 4 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">What are the different kinds of mold?
The most common types of mold you may find in your home or office include aspergillus, cladosporium and stachybotrys atra (black mold). Aspergillus is an allergenic mold that is commonly found on foods and may infest home HVAC/air conditioning systems. Cladosporium is a black or green mold that may grow on the backs of toilets, painted surfaces and fiberglass air ducts. It is usually non-toxic but can trigger allergy symptoms such as red and watery eyes, rashes and throat irritation. Orange or red mold is typically found outdoors and thrives on moist and decaying wood. It may appear slimy and is an eyesore, but is harmless. You may choose to remove it from your home for aesthetic reasons. White mold is not technically considered mold, but may indicate that a mold problem is only in the early stages of growth and may be easily treated.
