In this economy, many people are steering clear of very expensive getaways. One advantage of taking a cruise is the amazing pricing. Most cruise lines are all-inclusive packages. This includes a person's cruise fare, lodging, food and some onboard entertainment and sightseeing. Cruise lines make it easy for the worrisome traveler by including everything they need. Instead of having to book plane tickets, call a hotel and then have to pay for food and entertainment separately, cruises offer it all.  When a cruise trip is booked, the traveler can rest easy knowing no further calls have to be made, except to figure out their transportation to the port of departure.

<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">The Benefits of a Cruise</p>

<!-- Paragraph 1 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"> A Cruise Vacation Offers Great Value. Cruises offer great value for your vacation dollar because the fares include nearly everything you'll need for a fantastic trip: food, accommodations, daytime and evening entertainment and transportation between travel destinations. We regularly see cruise deals on mainstream cruise lines. Cruise Ships are Family Friendly. From tots to teens, grandparents to grandkids, family cruises are fun for all ages. If you're struggling to find a vacation that your 5-, 10- and 15-year-olds will all love -- and that has adult activities, too -- ships now have extensive kids' facilities, split by age. Teens have their own cool hangouts, far away from the play areas for the little ones (and certainly a nice distance from parent-friendly pools and bars). How can you not love a trip that features video games and swimming pools, while offering time for families to be together at dinner or onshore excursions? And parents can even sneak in a romantic dinner alone, by taking advantage of late-night hours in the kids' club.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 2 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">See Multiple Destinations, Unpack Only Once. On a cruise, you unpack once and your floating hotel takes you from city to city or from island to island and there's no need to mess with train or ferry schedules, or lug your suitcase along cobblestone streets. Every morning, you'll wake up in a new place. Can't decide between St. Lucia and Barbados, or Italy or Spain? Why choose? Pick an itinerary that visits all the cities on your wish list.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 3 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Cruise Ships Come in All Shapes and Sizes. The ideal cruise ship for one person may be a mega-ship outfitted with onboard rock-climbing walls and outdoor movie theaters, while another will prefer an intimate ship with an upscale ambience and someone else will want the seafaring experience of a masted tall sailing ship. Luckily, all those different types of cruise ships exist.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 4 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Ships Offer a Variety of Onboard Activities. Today's cruise ships are designed to keep everyone happy. Want to pamper yourself at the spa while your spouse hits the casino? Or lounge in the sun reading a book while your family plays basketball. You can go to an educational lecture, a wine tasting, a computer class or a dance workshop; paint pottery, play bridge, learn a language or do yoga; dine at a casual buffet, a fancy sit-down restaurant, a sushi bar, a diner or a steakhouse; watch a movie, a comedy routine, a song-and-dance show or live music performance. And if all you want to do is nothing while the ship sails from port to port you can do that, too.</p>
