Cannabis Oil: An Alternative To Prescription Drugs, Legal In All 50 States
By Jonathan Carson | April 13, 2017 | Health

(Health Review) ??? If you haven't already heard, Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive component of Cannabis that seems to have a wide range of therapeutic benefits. According to the United States own Government Patent #6,630,507, it supports the "nutritional health of aging bodies". Cannabinoids have been clinically validated for limiting neurological damage following stroke and trauma, and in the treatment of diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Preclinical studies suggest that CBD may have therapeutic benefits in the treatment of various conditions, including chronic pain, anxiety, nausea, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetes, PTSD, alcoholism, strokes and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and more.

We asked medical expert, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Neurosurgeon and award-winning CNN Chief Medical Correspondent about CBD. "The science is there. We have been terribly and systematically misled [about cannabis] for nearly 70 years in the United States. It does NOT have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications". 

For long term health and wellness use, CBD is one of the best ways to keep a body healthy.
