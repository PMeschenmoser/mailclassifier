<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 11pt;"><b>(Fox News)</b> ??? You could hear a pin drop as President Donald Trump spoke before the packed room and revealed each step of his economic plan behind the "Make America Great Again" initiative.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 11pt;">"You know, there are a lot of opportunities for every American to earn real money, to create real personal wealth. But the Washington elite are dragging their feet, and media would rather report fake news stories than inform the American people how to escape the financial crisis. Very powerful individuals have rigged the system for themselves. And both media and Washington are siding with them. Believe me, they will go to any lengths to keep hard working American men and women in debt, rather than lose thier own financial benefits."</span></p>

Service wasn't great but food and salsas made up for it!!....Travis had the green Chile enchiladas and  I had the tacos.... I could write an article about how good this place was. All those years living in El Paso and I didn't think it was good back then. But after today's meal I...

Delicious tacos!!..This place just replaced my weekly stop at Taco Tote. It was so good. I was so impressed. I really was. ..I'm the pickiest person in case... Fast and polite service bringing you delicious, authentic tacos. That's what I found when I gave Santa Cecilia a try. ....When you come in, you get chips, but... This place is LEGIT! We came for the menudo which was delicious. Then we ordered tacos and everything was insanely delicious! Service was so quick and all... Zino's is a solid place to get your grub on. It gets a little packed at lunch, but the service is quick so it shouldn't be an issue if you're short on time.... 30 years ago we had our wedding rehearsal here....it was great!
