FoxNews: Tump Signs Executive Order To "Make Americans Wealthy Again", exclusively here: http://findout.dressuj.us/straight/12548343_wealthy


My husband and I have been on a Nizi Sushi kick recently, so I figured it's about time that I write a review. ....First off, here's a list of my menu... Blaze is such a welcome edition to Newark! It's conveniently located near NJPAC, Prudential Center, and Penn Station. On a warm day, you could grab your pie... So freaking good! - I am not a HUGE fan of Thai but this is definitely one of the very few places where almost everything on the menu appeals to me. I've... I was introduced to this place by my colleague as the chipotle of Mediterranean food and I have been totally hooked on to this. The shawarma is just... I love going there, it is always so nice to see a little at work family.  Everyone gets along and the service is always wonderful.  Warm smiles and warm... Fantastic Food! I love all their food options. Whether you're getting a lunch combo or hot food ordered fresh from the kitchen everything comes out great.... My boyfriend and I came here with a groupon.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<!-- Headline -->
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: medium;">"The American people cannot wait any longer! As the President, I must act on behalf of every citizen when the corrupt politicians in Washington would rather see our good American men and women enslaved in debt!", Donald J. Trump.</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 11pt;"><b>(Fox News)</b> ??? You could hear a pin drop as President Donald Trump spoke before the packed room and revealed each step of his economic plan behind the "Make America Great Again" initiative.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 11pt;">"You know, there are a lot of opportunities for every American to earn real money, to create real personal wealth. But the Washington elite are dragging their feet, and media would rather report fake news stories than inform the American people how to escape the financial crisis. Very powerful individuals have rigged the system for themselves. And both media and Washington are siding with them. Believe me, they will go to any lengths to keep hard working American men and women in debt, rather than lose thier own financial benefits."</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 11pt;">"Well, guess what ??? I am putting an end to that, right now!" Trump announced as he was signing the executive order.</span></p>
