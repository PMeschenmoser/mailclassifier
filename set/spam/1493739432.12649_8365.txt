Severe weather alert: U. S.  study finds tornadoes coming in swarms

=20

In the face of rising prices, poor customer service and ever more frequent =
blackouts over fee disputes, many consumers yearn for a way out of the grip=
 of their cable TV subscription.  Though companies such as Google, Intel, S=
ony and Apple are all working on Internet-delivery TV platforms, none have =
yet secured the content deals needed to launch a credible service.  And whi=
le industry analysts point out that the number of cord cutters has yet to r=
each the critical mass needed to force changes to the cable TV business mod=
el, the fact is that today there are viable TV options to the triple digit =
cable bill.=20

These do require additional hardware, running extra cables from your TV, an=
d waiting at least a day to watch the newest episodes of cable network show=
s.  And if you're hoping to sever all ties with your cable provider, that's=
 not going to be an option in many regional markets, as you'll still need t=
hem for the high-speed Internet service that makes this all work.  But the =
cost savings of dropping the TV package can be substantial, and there have =
never been as many good choices available as there are today in both hardwa=
re and content.  Here's what you'll need.  Antenna

Remember the days when you could watch network television for free? (those =
under 25, ask your parents).  Well those channels are still available at no=
 cost. . . if you have an antenna.  And no, we're not talking about the clu=
nky rabbit ears of old.  Antennas have changed substantially in looks and p=
erformance over the last several years.  Breakthroughs in technology spurre=
d by development of the tiny but powerful digital antennas in smartphones h=
ave been adapted to the realm of TV reception.  The result? "TV antennas to=
day are 10 of the mass they were decades ago," says Richard Schneider, pres=
ident of Missouri-based manufacturer Antennas Direct.  "And the move to an =
all digital transmission that the FCC FMOCY + mandated back in 2009 has put=
 those TV signals in a higher frequency which means a better signal with le=
ss noise".  Armed with technology that makes a smaller antenna possible and=
 a digital protocol that makes the signals easier to capture over longer di=
stances, antenna companies are now delivering powerful long-range units wit=
h home decor as a design directive, resulting in small, unobtrusive and eve=
n fashionable indoor models.  Mark Buff, CEO of antenna maker Mohu says tha=
t with cable TV having been the norm for so long, "many people had forgotte=
n that OTA (over the air) signals still exist.  But we're now seeing increa=
sed interest by cord cutters.  And even customers who aren't cancelling sub=
scriptions are using antennas for second and third TVs as well as for their=
 vacation homes, saving the cost of additional cable boxes. "

These antennas are compatible with all televisions made since 2007 (when bu=
ilt-in digital tuners became a federal requirement) and they plug directly =
into the coaxial port in back of your TV.  Once plugged in, you simply have=
 your TV scan for available digital signals.  Most TVs have a signal meter =
display that shows just how well each channel's signal is being received.=
=20

I put a couple of units to the test and found that the new breed of antenna=
s really work as advertised.  In an environment like New York City with num=
erous obstacles to transmission towers, a major selling point of cable TV i=
n the analog era was that it was the only reliable way to get a clear signa=
l from the free network channels.  But today, on a lower floor of my Brookl=
yn brownstone, I can get 60 OTA channels with a small tabletop antenna like=
 the $50 Mohu Curve, which has a 30-mile antenna range.  It did take a bit =
of trial and error to find the spot in the room with the strongest signal f=
or most stations, but I got the best results by placing it near a window.=
=20

If you (and your significant other) are comfortable with a larger, more ind=
ustrial design, the $100 ClearStream 2 is an indoor/outdoor antenna that bo=
asts a 50-mile range.  The benefit of the more powerful Clearstream 2 is th=
at I could place it anywhere in the room and pull in 70 channels, ranging f=
rom the major networks to PBS affiliates and local Spanish and Chinese lang=
uage broadcasts.=20

The major network channels are all broadcast in HD.  And you'll be pleasant=
ly surprised to learn that the quality of uncompressed HD video in an anten=
na feed is actually superior to what you've been getting with your cable bo=
x.  Cable operators have to deliver hundreds of channels, plus broadband an=
d phone service over a single connection to your home, so the TV signal is =
usually compressed to conserve bandwidth.  Not so with your OTA feed.  The =
difference is immediately noticeable.  Outside of a Blu-ray movie, this is =
the best output I've ever seen on my TV.  And did I mention the channels ar=
e free?
Set Top Box

To augment your free supply of live network TV, the next step is to choose =
your hardware for on-demand programming delivered via your Internet connect=
ion.  You may already have this capability in an existing device if you own=
 a gaming console like an Xbox 360, Sony Playstation 3 or Nintendo Wii.  Or=
 perhaps you've bought a smart TV or Blu-ray player with built-in Wi-Fi.  I=
f you do need to buy a set top box, the most popular options are the $100 A=
pple TV and the range of models from Roku.  Google entered the field this s=
ummer with its $35 Chromecast, but its limited content makes it more a curi=
osity than primary option for mainstream consumers at this point.  But it's=
 definitely worth keeping an eye on.=20

In general, streaming hardware all works the same way.  The device connects=
 to both the Internet (via Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and your TV (via HDMI), strea=
ming content from channels that are either free or require a monthly subscr=
iption.  You browse through channels directly on your TV screen via a remot=
e.  A large part of the appeal here is that you choose which channels you w=
ant to subscribe to.  Netflix and Hulu Plus, the most popular channels (ava=
ilable on the Apple, Roku and Google devices) provide access to a robust se=
lection of movies as well as current and past TV shows.=20

Apple TV, tightly integrated into the Apple ecosystem, gives you access to =
content from iTunes as well as the ability to stream content from any iOS d=
evice to your TV.  If you're in an Apple-centric household and want to add =
the customary "Designed in Cupertino" fit and finish, there's much to like =
with Apple TV.=20
