<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">===================</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Dear Subscriber bruce@untroubled.org,</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">This is a true story:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Not long ago, my buddy Mike went to grab his cellphone when he noticed a few missed calls from his mother and a text message that simply said...</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">"Please call me as soon as you can"</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Sensing something was wrong, he called back right away, and when he did...he received the terrible news:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">His grandmother, a huge part of his childhood and like a second mother to him, had not only had a massive heart attack a few hours before...</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">...after arriving at the intensive care unit, she literally died twice on the stretcher before the doctors and nurses were finally able to get her stabilized.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">As with almost every heart attack sufferer, there's a good chance she never even expected such a horrible experience to happen to her.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">And like most, she probably assumed that if it did, she'd only know it by a little numbness in her arm or a sudden jolt of pain in her chest.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">But guess what?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">There are actually three other odd signs a heart attack may be about to strike, and since heart attacks kill one person every 90 seconds in America, I want to share these warning signs with you now so you know them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">After all, minutes matter when it comes to a heart attack and saving your life or someone you love.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">So here they are:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">#1: A feeling of unexplainable anxiety and impending doom. Your body is hardwired to protect vital systems in your body, so when things are about to turn bad, you can often sense it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">#2: Shortness of breath. You're fine one second, but then as your heart stops getting the blood and oxygen it needs, you're struggling to to breathe.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">#3: Feeling nauseous and sweating profusely. How many folks do you think assumed they ate some bad food or were out of shape to explain feeling uneasy, and then not long after, found themselves clutching their chest when a heart attack strikes?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">You've probably been lead to believe you can only avoid a heart attack if you have great genetics or are able to shun away all the foods you love to eat.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">But guess what?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">In this short video, you'll see that you can use a simple 10 second trick to promote a healthier heart, more energy, and better health overall.</span></p>
