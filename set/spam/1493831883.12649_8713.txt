I love this place.  I have stayed here twice and have been impressed each time.  The most recent stay was in June and under the new ownership.... My first experience with The Red Pepper Grill was at an event they catered at Eagle Station in Patterson.  I don't know how they pulled it off but they... Pleasantly surprised! Great place and great service...the food is as authentic as what I have had in Thailand...to find this tucked away in Waycross is... I don't usually eat sushi, but this is an exception. Staff is very polite, and they'll help carry your food out to your car. Food is all amazing, it gives... My family has been eating at Sybil's for YEARS. When I come back to town for a visit, I must have Sybils. I love their buffet. The catfish is really good,... Fantastic food. Really friendly staff. Salad bar is fresh and has several different salads on it. Plus dessert. Plus bread. Plus soup!  I had stuffed... I'm a local fan of this place- always have been always will be.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
