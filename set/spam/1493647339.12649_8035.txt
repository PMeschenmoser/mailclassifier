Large variety of food on the new menu including steaks, burgers, Mexican food, and seafood. Of course, the pizza is still some of... We stopped for lunch on our way to Arkansas. Very good BBQ!

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: medium;">"The American people cannot wait any longer! As the President, I must act on behalf of every citizen when the corrupt politicians in Washington would rather see our good American men and women enslaved in debt!", Donald J. Trump.</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 11pt;"><b>(Fox News)</b> ??? You could hear a pin drop as President Donald Trump spoke before the packed room and revealed each step of his economic plan behind the "Make America Great Again" initiative.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 11pt;">"You know, there are a lot of opportunities for every American to earn real money, to create real personal wealth. But the Washington elite are dragging their feet, and media would rather report fake news stories than inform the American people how to escape the financial crisis. Very powerful individuals have rigged the system for themselves. And both media and Washington are siding with them. Believe me, they will go to any lengths to keep hard working American men and women in debt, rather than lose thier own financial benefits."</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 11pt;">"Well, guess what ??? I am putting an end to that, right now!" Trump announced as he was signing the executive order.</span></p>
