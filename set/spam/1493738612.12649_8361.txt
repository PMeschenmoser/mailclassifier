Jamrock sets the bar for that real Jamaican tasting food. Many menu options mean there is always something else delicious to try. Very knowledgeable staff.... Great food. Decent prices and never a wait. They have about 8- 10 registers and always fully staffed. The employees are friendly. This is the best BBQ I've had in Atl. No gimmicky hot Q. Just Southern smoked Q. The place even smells right. The Brunswick Stew is incredibly flavorful.... I've attended a couple of shows with miracle plays and each time I enjoyed the show. The host and actors ensured everyone was engaged and had a good time. Very good. I love their food and miss the convenience of living next to this place. Will definitely be back! Park Street Pizza is hands-down the best pizza I have ever eaten in my life. Add to that the fact that Rocky the owner is a fantastic guy who supports kids... We are there twice in this visit and really enjoyed it both meals. Breakfast was delicious. Quick service and great menu options. We did not get the buffet... Down home goodness!
