Megyn Kelly Secret Side Project Exposed, Only Here: http://haveit.properb.us/legislator/13076486_truth_exposed


Wings are great. The beer offering is usually pretty great and turns over frequently. I wish they'd bring back the Cuban sandwich. Central New York State has a world class barbecue joint...Who knew ?..We had a college reunion in nearby Hamilton and I stopped in on my way there to scout... Amazing dinner! I had the salmon for dinner, and was very satisfied. Previous reviewers complained about price, but I think the food items are fairly priced... Stayed as a B\u0026B guest with my husband and enjoyed the restaurant for breakfast-a wonderful experience! Roger and Charles are very thoughtful hosts and and... The Copper Turret is hands down the best of the best. I used to eat here regularly when I was a student at SUNY Morrisville. A few friends and I stopped... La Iguana is a Mexican restaurant smack dab in the middle of Hamilton. It's decent sized, has plenty of tables and a full bar! They have The BEST frozen... Our best air bnb suggested this place for our dinner option...The restaurant is Bohemian style as the name, it is interesting...Love their Mushroom with...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
