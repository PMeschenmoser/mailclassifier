Awesome pub, very friendly staff. Had the shepherd's pie, very tasty. Large selection of draft beer.  A little bit of Ireland in Oxford Stopped in on a Friday night on a whim. Super cute quaint place. Upon arriving they asked if we made a reservation (we didn't), but they shockingly had a... The Tap is, IMO, the best in town for beer and a burger except lately I've been stuck on the Tap style wings and the perch dinner.  All the food we tried... This is one of my go-to's. The spinach and artichoke dip is amazing, beer selection is great, food is always hot and fresh. Even their pizza is awesome. This is a mom and pop Thai restaurant and it shows in the quality of the food.  I was spoiled as this was my first introduction to Thai food and as of yet,... Not only are the sandwiches fabulous, the service is too. Great place to have a quick, healthier lunch or dinner. This place has great pizza, and even bettef8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
