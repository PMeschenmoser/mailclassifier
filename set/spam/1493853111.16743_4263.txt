  <p>Shopping at a warehouse store and making bulk purchases can be a great=
 way to save money. Here are 8 reasons why you should shop at Costco. It wa=
s over twenty years ago that I started shopping at Costco-the-store-formerl=
y-known-as-Price-Club. FishPapa and I were just dating then. (His nickname =
was Fish.) We lived in Santa Barbara; the nearest Price Club was in Oxnard.=
 It was a good 45-minute drive, but it was worth it. Often it was his mom a=
nd I who would make the drive, eating at the nearby Soup Plantation or grab=
bing a hot dog at the food court. Years later in my first pregnancy, Fish a=
nd I would make that long drive through dinner time traffic just for the ho=
t dogs Over the years, Costco has come to provide our family with huge savi=
ngs on a number of items that we regularly buy. While we don't buy everythi=
ng we eat at this warehouse store, we do buy a fair number of things. A Cos=
tco membership is a valuable weapon for me in the battle against high groce=
ry bills. Here's why: 1. Lowest prices on many staples</p>=20
  <p>Costco offers us the lowest price on most of the dairy, bread, and fre=
sh produce that we buy. Organic eggs for $3.50/dozen? Yes, please. My list =
of regular items includes: sourdough and rye breads, English muffins, bagel=
s, deli turkey breast, Tillamook cheese, shredded mozzarella, sausages, egg=
s, milk, yogurt, bacon, beans, pasta, tomato products, olives, bananas, app=
les, and spices.<br /> 2. Easier bulk buying I buy a lot of food. A lot. Th=
ere are some things that it just doesn't make sense to buy in small package=
s. The bulk buying &acirc;?? and the bulk pricing &acirc;?? really works fo=
r me. I particularly love buying in bulk when I'm going to do some freezer =
cooking. Just pay attention to prices. Costco ginormous package isn't alway=
s the cheapest. I keep a price book in my head to make sure I'm not spendin=
g more than I should. 3. Discount non-food stuff We've bought eyeglasses, o=
rthotics, tires, and car loans through Costco. All have been really good de=
als. Costco sells appliances, tools, dishes, clothes, etc. The selection is=
 not vast, but the prices are generally good. 1. Lowest prices on many stap=

 Just pay attention to prices. Costco ginormous package isn't always the c=
heapest. I keep a price book in my head to make sure I'm not spending more =
than I should. 3. Discount non-food stuff We've bought eyeglasses, orthotic=
s, tires, and car loans through Costco. All have been really good deals. Co=
stco sells appliances, tools, dishes, clothes, etc. The selection is not va=
st, but the prices are generally good. 8. No-questions-asked return policy =
If you don't like something you buy at Costco, you can return it without an=
y issue. You must have original packaging, but they are great about returns=
, even when I don't have a receipt.</p>=20
  <p>I had plants die shortly after planting once, and they had me dig the =
plants up and return them. Then I got the money back. Easy-peasy. This poli=
cy makes it easy to try something, risk-free. They started carrying canned =
skipjack tuna last fall at a significantly cheaper price than their albacor=
e. I gave it a shot, but we didn't like it. I took back the other cans in t=
he pack and got my money back.</p>=20
  <p>Oh, the mysteries of Costco&acirc;?&brvbar;the $200 store as many peop=
le call it. Does it save you money? Are the deals as good as they seem? Is =
it worth having a membership? How do you shop there and not lose your entir=
e paycheck? All great questions. I consider myself to be a bit of a Costco =
expert. Not only have I been shopping there my whole life (yes, family outi=
ngs to Costco as a kid were the bomb), but having the brain I do, I've beco=
me fascinated with it and have made a point to learn everything I can about=
 it. This has led to my doing several TV segments about shopping at Costco,=
 and even getting personally invited to an exclusive behind-the-scenes view=
 of the store by a Costco GM. Over the years my &acirc;??How to shop at Cos=
tco&acirc;?=9D posts have gone viral. But yesterday on Instagram I posted a=
 picture of some good deals I snagged at Costco. It led to lots of great qu=
estions and lots of interest in Costco shopping. It made me realize that my=
 &acirc;??Costco Fundamentals&acirc;?=9D posts are so old, I bet hardly any=
 of you have actually seen them Thus, today I've compiled below ALL THINGS =
COSTCO so you can have all the best resources in one place! (P.S. pretty mu=
ch all of these tips can be applied at most Warehouse stores, but since Cos=
tco is my boyfriend, that's who I'm focusing on today.) This post breaks do=
wn how to budget for Costco, what to buy and what to avoid, how to use thei=
r coupons, tricks for getting tons of cash back on your membership, and muc=
h, much, more. Hope you enjoy</p>  =20
