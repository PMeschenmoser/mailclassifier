We had the catfish dinners and bread pudding for dessert. The desserts are definitely made for two. The staff... Every small town in America needs a place where folks can chat over coffee and a heaping plate of biscuits and gravy...the Barb Wire Grill is this place.... Margaritas are perfect. The helpings are hearty. Everything I've had from here tastes as authentic as it gets. I would give it five stars but the fried ice... First of all, garlic bread, dinner rolls and fried cheese are not Chinese food. Second, I got severely ill halfway through my meal and had to leave. Please... A locals hangout:....No visit to Carmi to visit my Dad is complete without at least one visit to The Coffee Shop on West Main across from Montgomery... Great prices!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
