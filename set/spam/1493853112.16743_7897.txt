Hi,

My name is Li Ka-shing, a philanthropist and the founder of Cheung Kong Holdings and Li Ka Shing Foundation, I am the Chairman of the Board of Hutchison Whampoa Limited (HWL) and Cheung Kong Holdings, the world's largest operator of container terminals and the world's largest health and beauty retailer. We offer support to children through innovative education initiatives. Our core focus is to encourage enterprise through education, training and building the right skills today so our young people can become the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. I believed strongly in ‘giving while living.’ I had one idea that never changed in my mind — that you should use your wealth to help people and I have decided to give USD$1,200.000.00 (One Million Two Hundred Thousand United State Dollars) to randomly selected individuals worldwide. On receipt of this email, you should count yourself as the lucky individual. Your email address was chosen online while searching at random. Kindly get back to me at your
  earliest convenience, so
