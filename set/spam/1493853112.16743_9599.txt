Hello Dear,

My Names are Jessica Williams. I am the Administrative manager at a vault financial & security Institution here in Barcelona. I am contacting you based on a financial opportunity I discovered here in my Bank. It's about an abandoned sum of $6. 7M Us Dollars (Six million, Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars) in our save deposit vault, that belongs to one of our foreign customers, a citizen of your country that share the same surname with you, who died along with his entire family on the 11th march 2006 in a ghastly car accident in Porto Portugal.

The banking policy can only allow the release of such funds to a benefactor through an application as next of kin to the deceased. After his death, the bank has been expecting a possible beneficiary, but no luck, this institution has exploited all its ethical possibilities in other to contact his possible relatives or inheritors, but to no success since nobody has come over for the claim of the funds for the past 10 years. I have made my own research with the help of a private investigator, it is my knowledge that this man has been living in Barcelona for the past 22 years and has never returned back home. I also learnt that his wife and 13 year old daughter died along with him during the car accident. I am 100% sure that no one is aware of the existence of these funds.

However, because of the international financial crises, a lot of reform has been made within the Spanish financial system, this includes the new law on succession of claims which indicates a duration in which such inheritance could be tolerated. The Bank of Spain has mandated our institution to release the funds to the inheritor. Failure to respond to this ultimatum would legally allow the Bank of Spain to confiscate the funds as unclaimed funds (Which of course would go straight to the Government's pocket). It is therefore upon this entire discovery that I have decided to contact you. I want you to know that I am a senior member of this office. As an insider, I am equipped with all classified secret information regarding the release of these funds. I would dedicate to make sure that I feed you with all possible documentation and information required for the approval and release of these funds.

Upon your acceptance to cooperate, I agree that 40% of this money will be for you, 60% for me. For time difference and confidential reasons, I strongly advice that you should get back to me via my private email address at (jessicavivian_williams@aim.com) with your contact details immediately you acknowledge the receipt of this mail, so that I would be able to inform you on how this could be concluded. In conclusion, it's my concern to demand your ultimate honesty, co-operation and confidentiality to enable us conclude this transaction.

 I fully assure you that this process would be executed under a legitimate arrangement that would legally protect you from any breach of law.


Regards,
Miss.Jessica V.Williams
