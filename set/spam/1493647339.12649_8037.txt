This restaurant is consistently excellent. They seem to be able to accommodate all tastes and food restrictions. The hostess and Waite staff are exceptional... Stopped in for lunch and had the brisket and pulled pork. Both were excellent. Enjoyed the sweet red sauce with a touch of hot added in. Definitely worth it. We were in town for two night to watch some spring training baseball. Found The Gifford through yelp and could not have been happier. So we went twice. ....I...

A truly great place for lunch or Dinner.   Gets very busy around 6 pm and they do not take reservations.   Worth a 15 min wait at the Bar area. Today we had the chicken tortilla soup. A must try. So full of chicken and wonderful flavor. ....Yucantan did not disappoint. ....Tried the carne Assad... Love this place!

We saw this place off the highway and decided to give it a chance. I am glad we did. Service was fast, clean bathrooms, friendly waiters.....A tad pricy but... Most efficient and friendly Cracker Barrel we have been to with good food!  We have been traveling across the country for several days and stop at Cracker... Ignored the ratings as usual. Glad i did. Salmon was amazing. Hot wings fantastic. Salad bar delicious. Service 5 star. Coming from NYC you get used to... After two visits I found the food to be fresh and great quality. Prices are more than reasonable with larger portions. However the staff could be more friendly. Pleasantly surprised. Family first time and service was quick and the food pretty tasty. Not like some Tex mex that's bland, this had seasoning. Mid range... Service was a bit slow but the servers were pleasant. I had the Bird of Paradise which was surprisingly moist and not too heavy with oil. It was a nice stop... Thank you again Yelp!   I use Yelp all the time to help me find a good meal off the beaten path.   You know, the place the locals frequent. Well this was...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</span></p>
