tack?</em></u><br />
<br />
There are actually three odd signs a heart attack may be about to strike,<b=
r />
and since <u><strong>heart attacks kill one person every 90 seconds</strong=
></u> in America,<br />
I want to share these warning signs with you now so you know them. After<br=
 />
all, minutes matter when it comes to a heart attack and saving your life or=
<br />
someone you love!<br />
<br />
So here they are:<br />
<br />
#1: A feeling of unexplainable anxiety and impending doom.<br />
Your body is hardwired to protect vital systems in your body,<br />
so when things are about to turn bad, you can often sense it.<br />
<br />
#2: Shortness of breath. You&rsquo;re fine one second, but then as your<br =
/>
heart stops getting the blood and oxygen it needs, you&rsquo;re struggling<=
br />
to to breathe.<br />
<br />
#3: Feeling nauseous and sweating profusely. How many folks do<br />
you think assumed they ate some bad food or were out of shape to<br />
explain feeling uneasy, and then not long after, found themselves<br />
clutching their chest when a heart attack strikes?<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ve probably been lead to believe you can only avoid a heart attac=
k<br />
if you have great genetics or are able to shun away all the foods you<br />
love to eat. But guess what? A <u><strong>simple 7 second trick</strong></u=
> may actually be<br />
able to prevent a <em>DEADLY</em> heart-attack!<br />
<br />
