r=3D"0" alt=3D"Cleopatra must be allowed to have her way. On the morning =
of the battle, when the ships were drawn up in array, Cleopatra held the =
command of a division of fifty or sixty Egyptian vessels, which were all =
completely manned, and well equipped with masts and sails. She took good =
care to have every thing in perfect order for flight, in case flight shou=
ld prove to be necessary. With these ships she took a station in reserve,=
 and for a time remained there a quiet witness of the battle. The ships o=
f Octavius advanced to the attack of those of Antony, and the men fought =
from deck to deck with spears, boarding-pikes, flaming darts, and every o=
ther destructive missile which the military art had then devised. Antony'=
s ships had to contend against great disadvantages. They were not only ou=
tnumbered by those of Octavius, but were far surpassed by them in the eff=
iciency with which they were manned and armed. Still, it was a very obsti=
nate conflict. Cleopatra, however, did not wait to see how it was to be f=
inally decided." /></a></td></tr>

r=3D"0" alt=3D"It must not be imagined by the reader that the scenes of v=
icious indulgence, and reckless cruelty and crime, which were exhibited w=
ith such dreadful frequency, and carried to such an enormous excess in th=
e palaces of the Egyptian kings, prevailed to the same extent throughout =
the mass of the community during the period of their reign. The internal =
administration of government, and the institutions by which the industria=
l pursuits of the mass of the people were regulated, and peace and order =
preserved, and justice enforced between man and man, were all this time i=
n the hands of men well qualified, on the whole, for the trusts committed=
 to their charge, and in a good degree faithful in the performance of the=
ir duties; and thus the ordinary affairs of government, and the general r=
outine of domestic and social life, went on, notwithstanding the profliga=
cy of the kings, in a course of very tolerable peace, prosperity, and hap=
piness. During every one of the three hundred years over which the histor=
y of the Ptolemies extends, the whole length and breadth of the land of E=
gypt exhibited, with comparatively few interruptions, one wide-spread sce=
ne of busy industry. The inundations came at their appointed season, and =
then regularly retired. The boundless fields which the waters had fertili=
zed were then every where tilled. The lands were plowed; the seed was sow=
n; the canals and water-courses, which ramified from the river in every d=
irection over the ground, were opened or closed, as the case required, to=
 regulate the irrigation. The inhabitants were busy, and, consequently, t=
hey were virtuous. And as the sky of Egypt is seldom or never darkened by=
 clouds and storms, the scene presented to the eye the same unchanging as=
pect of smiling verdure and beauty, day after day, and month after month,=
 until the ripened grain was gathered into the store-houses, and the land=
 was cleared for another inundation." /></a></td></tr>
