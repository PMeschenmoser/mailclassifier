I have been driving by this place for years and never knew it existed!!! ....We stopped for breakfast and it was so delicious.  Everything was homemade so... Salsa is made with tomato soup. Its pretty bad. Super cheap bulk cosco type chips. I had the worst poop from this place. I will never be back. Possibly THE BEST GLUTEN-FREE PIZZA I've ever had!!  (And I've had a LOT.)  Service and Atmosphere are top-notch, as well. What a delightful surprise.  This food ranks with any Paris bistro.  Excellent wines and service contribute to the making of a great meal. Food was great and the music was amazing! I ordered the Caprise and Rosotto. Finished it all. It's a cozy place but I ate at the bar. Gennaro's is some of the best Italian I have had, and I am honestly surprised to have found it in the Texas Hill Country. THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS!... Stumbled upon this place while walking along the river walk and saw it had great reviews so my girlfriend and I walked in. Dave asked if we had reservations... So excited to find good Thai food in a place this small. Thought I would have to give up curry and pho when we moved here. But then Thai Grill stepped in.... My wife and I have been to Huisache 15 to 20 times and we've never had a bad experience. I would say it's one of the best restaurants in New Braunfels.... Chef Jeff has been a business friend of mine for nearly 20 years, both of us finding our way down the culinary path of life...His prior endeavor at... Can I please leave six stars? Please please please?..I love you guys, please never leave me...If I lived in Campbell you would seriously be sick of me, I... Had my birthday here and it was such a great pick!  We came with a big group (about 10 people) and found a comfortable area upstairs.  It's a really low-key... Had to try the John Wayne burger since it seemed drool worthy and I was not disappointed! At first I thought it would be a leaky burger mess when trying to... Some clarifications before reading my post. I don't often go into the Campbell area, for the fact it's just too far for my family and I, but we needed to... Came here on a Saturday with my family. There were five of us, we waited about 35 mins (we got there at 7pm), so not bad. There's also a bar to enjoy beer... One enjoyable dinner at Willard Hicks.....Indeed it was, upon entering the restaurant (with a reservation), we were greeted by the hostess and promptly seated... Every dish I've had here is fantastic, just don't go in there if you're on a tight schedule and cannot meet the \"So-So\" requirement... You're on island time... Want to update my review......Back in 2015 I gave them a bad review, but since have been back twice. And this time I liked my lunch. We shared a Scotch eggs...
