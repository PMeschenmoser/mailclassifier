Dear Friend,

My name is Mrs Judith williams am 75yrs old of age, I stay in new york
city, USA.I am a good merchant, I have several industrial companies
and good share in various banks in the world. I spend all my life on
investment and coporate business.  Along the way, I lost my husband
and two beautiful kids in a fatal accident that occoured in November
5th 2013.

After the inccident that took away my  husband and two beautiful kids,
people ran away from me and now I realised that it's because of my
greedy I dont care about people before. Later in the year 2014 I was
sent a letter of medical check up from United Kingdon. My personal
Doctor testify that I have a lung cancer, which can easily take off my
life soon. I found it uneasy to survive myself, because a lot of
investment cannot be run and manage by me again. Presently I am in
United Kingdon for treatment because I dont know how long I am going
to stay again. I quickly call up a pastor/prophet to give me positive
thinking on this solution. He advised and minister to me to share my
properties ,wealth, to motherless baby/orphanage homes/people that
need money for survivor and for future raising. So I made up my
mind to follow the instructions. I am writing this letter to
people who really need help to contact me urgently. I have made
available preparation to share the funds in various banks in the worl

Please contact me and stop weeping. probably the little you can get
from me will improve your living. Let me know what you really need the
money for, and if you can still help me to distribute money to nearest
orhanage homes, feel free to contact me or you give me their contacts
so that I can reach them. May you be blessed, as you reach me. Please
to remind you, dont belongs to scammers or any act of fraudlent on
internet. I will give more information to you as I await your response
immediately.

Best Regards
Mrs Judith scott williams
