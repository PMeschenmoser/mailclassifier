<p>TESTIMONIALS: "The burning sensation on the soles of my feet has disappeared" - "Great news. The burning sensation on the soles of my feet has disappeared ??? thanks to your neuropathy formula. I have just finished my second bottle of Nerve Renew & the first bottle of nerve repair optimizer. Hopefully the balance & co-ordination will also improve meaningfully as I progress with the treatment. The burning sensation actually returned one night ??? after i had forgotten to take the pills. I got up at about 1 a.m. & took 2 pills. After a couple of hours the burning sensation completely disappeared." ~ Jon Walker ??? Cape Province South Africa</p>
