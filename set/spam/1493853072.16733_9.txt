hat having been, as will be recollected, the disposition of the respectiv=
e armies and their encampments upon the plain. Brutus was triumphantly su=
ccessful in his part of the field. His troops defeated the army of Octavi=
us, and got possession of his camp. The men forced their way into Octaviu=
s's tent, and pierced the litter in which they supposed that the sick gen=
eral was lying through and through with their spears. But the object of t=
heir desperate hostility was not there. He had been borne away by his gua=
rds a few minutes before, and no one knew what had become of him." /></a>=

 border=3D"0" alt=3D"The arrival of these re-enforcements greatly improve=
d Caesar's condition, and the circumstance of their coming forced upon th=
e mind of Ganymede a sense of the absolute necessity that he should gain =
possession of the harbor if he intended to keep Caesar in check. He accor=
dingly determined to take immediate measures for forming a naval force. H=
e sent along the coast, and ordered every ship and galley that could be f=
ound in all the ports to be sent immediately to Alexandria. He employed a=
s many men as possible in and around the city in building more. He unroof=
ed some of the most magnificent edifices to procure timber as a material =
for making benches and oars. When all was ready, he made a grand attack u=
pon Caesar in the port, and a terrible contest ensued for the possession =
of the harbor, the mole, the island, and the citadels and fortresses comm=
anding the entrances from the sea. Caesar well knew this contest would be=
 a decisive one in respect to the final result of the war, and he accordi=
ngly went forth himself to take an active and personal part in the confli=
ct. He felt doubtless, too, a strong emotion of pride and pleasure in exh=
ibiting his prowess in the sight of Cleopatra, who could watch the progre=
ss of the battle from the palace windows, full of excitement at the dange=
rs which he incurred, and of admiration at the feats of strength and valo=
r which he performed. During this battle the life of the great conqueror =
was several times in the most imminent danger. He wore a habit or mantle =
of the imperial purple, which made him a conspicuous mark for his enemies=
; and, of course, wherever he went, in that place was the hottest of the =
fight. Once, in the midst of a scene of most dreadful confusion and din, =
he leaped from an overloaded boat into the water and swam for his life, h=
olding his cloak between his teeth and drawing it through the water after=
 him, that it might not fall into the hands of his enemies. He carried, a=
t the same time, as he swam, certain valuable papers which he wished to s=
ave, holding them above his head with one hand, while he propelled himsel=
f through the water with the other." /></a></td></tr>
