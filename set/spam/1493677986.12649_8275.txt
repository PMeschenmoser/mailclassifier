Have An Unsightly, Embarrassing Mole You Want Gone? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

bruce@untroubled.org,

Do You Have A Mole Or Skin Tag You Want GONE?

You no longer have to suffer the embarrassment of unsightly moles on your body.
 
If you have ugly skin tags or moles on your face, neck, or body, you have a new choice.

The cost of having moles & skin tags surgically removed is expensive, and includes suffering through a painful procedure that involves cutting or burning.

Fortunately, that's no longer the case.  Surgery is NOT your only option.

In as little as three days, this painless alternative to traditional surgery lets you take care of moles and skin tags by yourself - in the privacy of your home - and save hundreds of dollars!
