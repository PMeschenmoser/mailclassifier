sp; </p> <p>&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp; </p> <p>Scientific evidenc=
e is mounting daily for what many have long sensed: that practices like min=
dfulness, meditation, and yoga can help us address certain intractable indi=
vidual and societal problems. Prominent companies &acirc;?? Google, General=
 Mills, Target, Apple, Nike, AOL, and Procter &amp; Gamble among them &acir=
c;?? and prominent individuals have already embraced this possibility. Tim =
Ryan, the Ohio congressman who wrote the book A Mindful Nation, has been a =
big proponent of bringing mindfulness to the masses. He, along with others,=
 believes that mindfulness should be a part of everyone's day, to help wire=
 our brains to deal with our many modern stressors.</p> <p>And, perhaps mor=
e importantly for our global health, for kids dealing with extreme stressor=
s, traumas and abuse, putting these practices into schools could be the dif=
ference between failure and success. Last month, a group of American and Ca=
nadian scholars, researchers, businesspeople, and yoga teachers came togeth=
er for a weekend at Omega Institute to discuss how this group of practices =
that helps us self-regulate as individuals could, quite possibly, help us r=
egulate on a society level. The issues the country is facing &acirc;?? the =
massive dropout rate of school kids, substance abuse among all age groups, =
PTSD among veterans, the staggeringly high incarceration and recidivism rat=
es &acirc;?? cost the country volumes in human potential, not to mention tr=
illions in dollars. There are no single solutions, but the evidence suggest=
s that some or all of these problems may be amenable to the practices that =
have been shown to redirect attention, improve concentration, increase self=
-control, and endow people with reliable and healthy coping mechanisms in t=
he face of stress and trauma. Some of the faculty at Omega's conference hav=
e been key players in making this happen. BK Bose, PhD, of the Niroga Insti=
tute, a former Silicon Valley engineer who grew up practicing yoga, now wor=
ks to make mindfulness/meditation/yoga the game-changer that many believe i=
t can be. Rob Schware, PhD, who heads the Give Back Yoga Foundation and the=
 Yoga Service Council, and writes for the Huffington Post, brought his two =
decades of management experience with World Bank to help grow the movement =
as a second career. Many, including Bose and Schware, say that the &acirc;?=
?school-to-prison pipeline,&acirc;?=9D a famously insidious and costly prob=
lem in lives lost and money wasted, is one of several that could be altered=
 by a little mindfulness training early on in life.</p> <p>In terms of econ=
omic cost alone, Cecelia Rouse at Princeton estimates that one high school =
dropout &acirc;??costs&acirc;?=9D about $260,000 in lost earnings over his =
or her lifetime. Given the fact that at least a million kids drop out of sc=
hool every year, the annual cost of school failure alone is estimated at $2=
60 billion. As Bose points out, &acirc;??Over ten years, the cost is upward=
s of 3 trillion dollars. And this is just for dropping out alone.&acirc;?=
=9D</p> <p>If you continue the trajectory a little further, he says, based =
on the relatively common course that can include juvenile hall and prison, =
the numbers grow. &acirc;??The school-to-prison pipeline is incredibly cost=
ly,&acirc;?=9D says Bose. It can cost upwards of $250,000 per year to keep =
an inmate in prison, if you factor in all the direct and indirect costs tha=
t tend to come with it, like loss in productivity, damage to the family, th=
e escalated health and mental health costs. &acirc;??Folks have been lookin=
g at career criminals &acirc;?? and estimates over their lifetimes are betw=
een $4-7 million. If you apply this to all those who land in jail over and =
over again, the numbers become stratospheric.&acirc;?=9D</p> <p>One approac=
h is to increase school retention; the national dropout rate is between 25 =
and 35, and up to 50 in inner city schools. But if you go back a necessary =
step, Bose argues, the real culprits are enormous stresses and traumas that=
 are so often present in the kids' lives. &acirc;??The single common denomi=
nator is stress: Chronic stress, toxic stress, traumatic stress, primary an=
d secondary post-traumatic stress. Trauma is endemic. The tentacles of stre=
ss and trauma run right through &acirc;?? domestic abuse, substances abuse,=
 poverty, racism. And once a kid drops out, homelessness, substance abuse, =
juvenile delinquency, crime, violence are just waiting to pounce. Not to me=
ntion the boatload of chronic disease, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, di=
abetes... You start to see this powerful trajectory between school failure =
and adult outcomes.&acirc;?=9D</p> <p>And this is where the capacity to cop=
e becomes highly relevant. Methods that train the brain attend differently,=
 self-regulate, and respond to stressors are one part. &acirc;??If you look=
 to neuroscience,&acirc;?=9D says Bose, &acirc;??it tells us that stress, a=
mong other things, disrupts brain functioning, especially in the prefrontal=
 cortex. And the same neuroscience is also saying there's also class of pra=
ctices that mitigate all of this: Mindfulness.&acirc;?=9D</p> <p>There's so=
me good evidence for the idea. In 2011, a Harvard study showed that mindful=
ness is linked to increased gray matter density in certain cortical areas, =
including the prefrontal cortex and regions involved in self-referential th=
oughts and emotion regulation. There seems to be a strong connection betwee=
n mindfulness and the brain machinery involved in self-regulation. Other wo=
rk has shown mindfulness to be linked to relative de-activation of the defa=
ult mode network (DMN), the brain system that's active during mind-wanderin=
g and self-referential &acirc;??worry&acirc;?=9D thoughts, which are genera=
lly stressful in nature. Indeed Jon Kabat-Zinn, MD at UMass has developed h=
is career to developing the mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBS=
R) to helping people learn to change the stress response. (For nice reviews=
 of the application of the practices in early childhood education, see this=
 2012 piece and this 2011 piece.)</p> <p>This is all well and good, Bose ad=
ds, but there's an obvious caveat. When they're in the midst of stress and =
trauma, few kids have the ability to sit still enough to take part in a sit=
ting practice. &acirc;??If you're not ready to sit in classroom,&acirc;?=9D=
 says Bose, &acirc;??you're not ready to do sitting meditation. If you have=
 drugs and gangs and violence all around you, you simply can't sit still. T=
eachers tell us that they often yell at kids 100 times a day to sit and pay=
 attention. It doesn't work. And to ask them to do this in the context of m=
editation can have a worse-than-neutral effect &acirc;?? it could be disast=
rous.&acirc;?=9D</p> <p>So, you have to go beyond the neuroscience-of-medit=
ation field and look to the trauma research, which tells us that physical a=
ctivity can help the brain deal with stress and trauma. &acirc;??Trauma res=
earch tell us that we hold trauma in our bodies&acirc;?&brvbar; The dorsola=
teral prefrontal cortex doesn't even talk to the amygdala. Neuroscience say=
s mindfulness; trauma research says movement. All of the sudden you've got =
moving meditation or mindfulness in motion. Mindfulness alone isn't going t=
o cut it for these kids.&acirc;?=9D One theory is that because the executiv=
e areas of the brain can be affected by stress and trauma, &acirc;??getting=
 in&acirc;?=9D through another avenue is key. Indeed, some studies have sho=
wn that physical activity can enhance cognitive control via the prefrontal =
cortex in children, and exercise is well known to enhance neurogenesis in b=
rain regions like the hippocampus, in you and old alike, which can be affec=
ted by stress (for a brief review, see here).</p> <p>Therefore, Bose and hi=
s colleagues have done what are also beginning to, combining movement and m=
indfulness into one program, called Transformative Life Skills (TLS), which=
 incorporates elements of movement, attention training and relaxation skill=
s. The 18-week program can be introduced to schools relatively cheaply. The=
 research so far has shown that it can be extremely helpful in helping kids=
 reduce levels of negative thinking, negative affect, revenge motivation, d=
epression, emotional arousal, physical arousal, rumination, perceived-stres=
s, attitudes toward violence; and it's been associated with greater levels =
of self-control, tolerance for distress, and school engagement.</p> <p>The =
return-on-investment seems to speak for itself. The cost of training and co=
aching 50 teachers in TLS is $5,000. And if they work with 1,000 students, =
works out to be about $5 per kid. If even one kid took a different path in =
life, the program would be worth the investment many times over.</p> <p>And=
 similar programs, like the one run by the Holistic Life Foundation, Inc. (=
HLF) serving inner city schools in Baltimore, have found just this. Ali Smi=
th, Executive Director, who founded the program along with his brother and =
college friend as a way to bring meditation to &acirc;??at-risk&acirc;?=9D =
kids, has seen the results firsthand. So has the early research. Smith and =
his brother grew up in this hectic environment, but his parents had them me=
diate every day before school. He says he didn't understand its purpose so =
much back then, but it made a difference on some level, and sparked his and=
 his brother's desire to give back in the same way as they got older. He ho=
pes that mindfulness will be a part of every school day in the future: &aci=
rc;??Even just to give kids a moment of stillness in their day, so that the=
y stop, and can have inner and outer silence&acirc;?&brvbar; That would be =
amazing.&acirc;?=9D</p> <p>One problem with this type of service at this ju=
ncture is the relatively small size of the operations. Though service progr=
ams are growing, many are still local in reach, and affect people only on t=
he order of tens or hundreds per year. &acirc;??What I see happening,&acirc=
;?=9D says Schware, &acirc;??is a lot of very fired up yoga teachers who wa=
nt to serve; so they go work in drug rehabs or jails.&acirc;?=9D After a ye=
ar or two, though, many realize they can't pay their bills while doing this=
 work, so find themselves in a difficult position. &acirc;??And if you've s=
et up a nonprofit,&acirc;?=9D adds Schware, &acirc;??it's even harder finan=
cially.&acirc;?=9D The Yoga Service Council helps many of these small non-p=
rofits become sustainable, but it's unclear where the future of the industr=
y really lies here, or in a larger domain.</p></td>=20
