Great service. Great food - out in the middle of no where! I will definitely remember this little spot! I'm originally from the Marietta area, and I have eaten at Austyn's a few times. I always knew they had the best spinach artichoke dip, but I never... Small place with old world character. Outstanding food. Schnitzel was great as well as the meatballs.

I wasn't expecting a \"life changing experience,\" but I also wasn't expecting the finest pork ribs ever and brilliantly-prepared chicken, either! We went... Excellent beer and food in an authentic German restaurant.  I am certain we were the only Americans in the place the evening we came.  I loved the Nuremberg...
