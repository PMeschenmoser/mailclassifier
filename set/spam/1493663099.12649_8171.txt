For as long as I've lived in Owensboro,  I don't know why it's taken me so long to try Real Hacienda. Tonight made my first visit to this Mexican restaurant... Very slow but adequate.....Why review a Wendy's? Because there's probably another one at the next exit and you don't want to have a negative dining experience... Food \u0026 coffee were good, although when asked for crispy hash browns they were not crispy.  Had to request silverware for one of the 2 of us.  ....Bathrooms... Tried Stellions' 8 pounder The Works today and it was so good! Our favorite pizza is The Pizza Place's The Deluxe, and this one supercedes! One slice will... This was our first time visiting. We live out of town and had heard it was a good local spot to try. We went with 4 adults and 1 kid on Easter eve at... The Catfish at this place is awesome to eat! I love their food. It's very delicious! I would recommend that anyone eat here. Excellent for catering or a great lunch/dinner. If you like fall off the bone ribs and chicken, if you like scrumptious, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth... Extremely bummed with my stop after a long day's work here. My chicken sandwich was so overcooked I could hear Gordon Ramsay's screams all the way from... Kathy's the Country Talking Staff that is happy to Serve you. I called ahead for Livers that are Super Good.  Dip'em in their honey mustard sauce. Be sure... This review is for the HOTEL as well as the restaurant... oddly, ..they're the same listing here at Yelp, but entirely different business types.....Be sure to... Unexpectedly great food! Very affordable breakfast for the portion size. The breakfast burrito was great. Good coffee. And well seasonsed, chunky homefries.... Stopped here on our family road trip to Glacier National Park. With a name like Notorious PIG how could you not stop?! ..We ordered the pulled pork and... Omg, cute, spunky little waitress. Great chicken fried chicken and amazing ribs. This is a road side hole in the wall you DON'T want to miss!!!..P.S. Tater... My husband's a New Yorker and we love this pizza! The Scilian pizza is our favorite--delicious sausage, roasted red peppers and fresh cheese. The dough is... Well you know where to find me in Missoula. Plonk could be the closet thing to wine heaven you can get in Montana. Amazing selection of wine, great craft... I'm not even all that big on this kind of food. I'll eat it, but I usually get the more 'merican food. But I can do it while drinking in (or out back of)... What a food find and also, what a fantastic chicken house! ..The Double Front Cafe raises the bar for the best chicken ever eaten in my book and definitely... Love James Bar! But, but, but........We've been coming here for 8 years, 8 years and I don't think much has changed with the exception of maybe a rotated menu...
