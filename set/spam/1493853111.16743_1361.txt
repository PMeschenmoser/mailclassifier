If you suspect you have a mold problem, it isn't wise to try to assess it yourself. Even if the problem is small and you think you can take care of it yourself, you will never know unless you call for a professional mold test. Some basic guidelines to follow: it's a good idea to call a professional if the mold covers a 3x3 foot area or larger, if the mold is growing on wood or drywall, if the mold appears to be black mold, if you have a medical condition that may be exacerbated by exposure to mold, if you or other property occupants have been having symptoms of mold exposure, if you suspect mold inside your walls or mold inside your subfloor, or if your property has a distinct moldy smell.

<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Mold FAQs</p>

<!-- Paragraph 1 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">What are the different ways I can get rid of mold in my house or business?
If you suspect you have a mold problem, it isn't wise to try to assess it yourself. Even if the problem is small and you think you can take care of it yourself, you will never know unless you call for a professional mold test. Some basic guidelines to follow: it's a good idea to call a professional if the mold covers a 3x3 foot area or larger, if the mold is growing on wood or drywall, if the mold appears to be black mold, if you have a medical condition that may be exacerbated by exposure to mold, if you or other property occupants have been having symptoms of mold exposure, if you suspect mold inside your walls or mold inside your subfloor, or if your property has a distinct moldy smell.
</p>

<!-- Paragraph 2 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">What is the process for mold removal?
The process for removal depends on the severity of the mold situation of your property, but there is a standard protocol that must be followed for proper handling and disposal of mold. Those steps involve finding and repairing the water source that is causing the water damage and mold, isolating the mold contamination area, suppressing dust so mold cannot travel to other areas of the property through the air. Then, the mold contaminated materials are removed and disposed of properly, the area is cleaned and sanitized according to Level 1 or Level 2 EPA Mold Remediation guidelines. Finally, the area is visually inspected, dried, and any removed material such as wood or drywall is replaced. 
</p>

<!-- Paragraph 3 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">What is the cost for mold removal?
Mold removal cost depends on the size and type of area that is mold-infested, the type of mold that must be handled, and the amount of repair work that must be done after the mold is remediated. When you are considering homeowners insurance, be sure to get something that will cover at least part of the remediation cost if you live in a flood zone or near another water source that may cause a mold problem. 
</p>

<!-- Paragraph 4 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">What are the different kinds of mold?
The most common types of mold you may find in your home or office include aspergillus, cladosporium and stachybotrys atra (black mold). Aspergillus is an allergenic mold that is commonly found on foods and may infest home HVAC/air conditioning systems. Cladosporium is a black or green mold that may grow on the backs of toilets, painted surfaces and fiberglass air ducts. It is usually non-toxic but can trigger allergy symptoms such as red and watery eyes, rashes and throat irritation. Orange or red mold is typically found outdoors and thrives on moist and decaying wood. It may appear slimy and is an eyesore, but is harmless. You may choose to remove it from your home for aesthetic reasons. White mold is not technically considered mold, but may indicate that a mold problem is only in the early stages of growth and may be easily treated.
