Hello,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I know this email will come to you as a surprise, but never mind. I am Mr. Solomon Simpson, Manager in Charge of Sovereign Wealth Funds; I propose to arrange a grant of at least US$25.5M to you for business investment.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
This grant attracts absolutely no interest, and will stay on the Bank's record for 6 months, after which it will be written off! This is possible because Sovereign Wealth Funds in my charge usually remain dormant (inactive) for years because some government officials in the Middle East who made the initial deposits intended to steal the funds after leaving office. But, they are either kicked out or killed in Office, and the Sovereign Wealth Funds accounts then go into dormant mode. Secondly, it is imperative to let you know that you are in very good position to receive this fund because of your nationality. This is because of the basic requirements and confidentiality agreement our firm has signed with the client in question is that the fund will be used in your region and that's why I need your partnership.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Therefore, It might interest you to know that if you help and corporate with me, I can help you on how to secure all the legal document that can be use to process your name as the real Beneficiary of this very fund US$25,500,000.00, plus, guide to all the necessary procedures regarding how this fund can be transfer into your Bank account in a week or less, with absolutely 100% risk free in the transaction. And when this transaction is fully finalized, you’re going to get 40% for your effort.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
If you are interested, then respond ONLY via my private email. Please clearly indicate the following. Considering the volume of discretion required for success of this project, I ask your reply to my private email: <FONT color=#000080><B><I>solomonsmpsn@gmail.com</B></I></FONT>.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
