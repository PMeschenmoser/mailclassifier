TESTIMONIALS: You have changed my life - "I can not believe how great i feel from taking this. You have changed my life. I really truly thought it was going to be a waste of money. I just discovered the b1 and 12 you use is really the only healing forms of that vitamin. Doctors only prescribe the other form which does nothing. Thank you so much. This is a miracle as far as I am concerned. Since January, I have been on this and my symptoms have disappeared." ~ Dennis Donoghue ??? Dorchester Maine
