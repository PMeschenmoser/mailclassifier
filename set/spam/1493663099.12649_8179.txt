*FREE*Military-Grade Headlamp  (Only S&H) , Only Here- http://searchtoday.vbjink.us/m/13082419  

A hidden gem in the Point City. Very good steaks and seafood. You can't go wrong with anything with a creole flair. You gotta try the gumbo. Went for lunch.  We shared the shrimp and grits and the blackened catfish.  Both were as good as you would want them to be.  ....I would eat there again. This was by far the best piece of meat I have ever had the honor to experience. Small intimate dining with a friendly staff. The grill is right out in front... Just incredible.  Great staff.  Great open floor plan.  ....The grilled Caesar is unique and very flavorful.....They were out of risotto (which is fortunate as... We hopped in a cab and had a plan to head to the Main Street and figure out dinner. Everyone in the cab told us to go to Restaurant Tyler so we obliged! We... The food was great. Got appetizer for a meal and subbed the fries for baked potato and it was enough for a meal and then chocolate fudge brownie f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
