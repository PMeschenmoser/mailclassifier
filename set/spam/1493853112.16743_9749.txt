personality with a humble heart to help the needy .

I am writing you this mail from my heart and i want you to know that before i contacted you ,i prayed and fasted to for my 

spirit  to lead me to the rightful person that will help me fulfill my last wishes and i believe he has directed you to me 

so you can help me.

My Name is Mrs. Lilly Patrick from United Kingdom,am  suffering from Breast Cancer, i need your prayers.
I am 63yrs old from United Kingdom England, affected with cancer of the breast. My condition is really deteriorating and 

is quite obvious that I may not live long enough , because the cancer stage has gotten to its 3rd stage that is the reason 

i retired from the United Nation refugees Aid Team in Africa especially in the war zone areas . 

After my Doctor Notice and warning over my health  ,i have decided to divide part of my fortune by contributing to the 

Charities & Motherless.

I am willing to donate my fortune worth (15 million dollars) to the poor through you. Can you help me?

With Love. Mother . Lilly Patrick
