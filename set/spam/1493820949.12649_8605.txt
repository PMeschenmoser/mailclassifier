<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">The Benefits of Sending Flowers</p>

<!-- Paragraph 1 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">If someone has a birthday, anniversary or other special occasion coming up and you don't what to get him or her, flowers are always a safe bet. Flowers are the ideal gift for virtually every occasion, from christenings and get well soon messages and especially Mother's Day. No matter what type of occasion you're celebrating, a florist can assist you in picking out the perfect floral arrangement to send to friends, family members or acquaintances.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 2 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Intimate Connections ~ Sending flower arrangements is also a great way to establish intimate connections and meaningful relationships. There is something touching about receiving flowers. It shows that someone took the time to think of you and send a bit of beauty and freshness your way. Additionally, if you send someone an arrangement of their favorite flowers, then it shows that you remembered a detail about their likes, which shows that you really pay attention to the person and care about them. According to the same study previously mentioned, sending flower arrangements led to more contact between family and friends, as well.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 3 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Immediate Happiness ~ Flowers portray an immediate sense of happiness. Almost every recipient of flowers instantly has a smile across his or her face, demonstrating true delight and gratitude. This is especially true if you send flowers to the place where someone works or goes to school because then your message is public letting not only the recipient, but the entire world, know that you care. This in and of itself speaks volumes to the recipient and can make him or her feel special.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 4 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Long-Term Positivity ~ Flowers brighten up a space and can make people feel less lonely and depressed. They can have a long-term positive effect on people's moods. According to a behavioral study conducted by the State University of New Jersey and headed by Jeannette Haviland-Jones, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology Research Findings, study participants reported feeling less anxious, agitated and depressed after receiving flowers and demonstrated a higher sense of enjoyment and satisfaction with life.</p>
